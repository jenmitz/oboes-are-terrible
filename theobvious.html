                Welcome to the Abyss of Loathing! This page is stop one on our tour. It is dedicated entirely to outlining the flaws of oboes that are obvious. It's easy to see, even on a surface level,
                how ridiculous some of the oboe's flaws are. After your inevitable frustration with oboes, you can (and should)
                continue to "The Absurd Unknown" page, which is stop two on this delightful tour of hatred. Try not to bang your head on the table too many times, because
                you'll need a strong mind to continue to an even more frustrating portion of our journey. Good luck with the next part.

                <h3>They are exorbitantly priced</h3>
                <p>It takes but one quick Google search to notice how expensive oboes are. It's important to note that I am rejecting any and all knock-off,
                    shit-quality oboes, like the plastic ones you can buy on eBay and Amazon. Those don't even count. They're useless garbage. They're worse than the real thing.
                    But real oboes, however, start at roughly $1,500 for a BEGINNER oboe. These oboes aren't even "full" oboes, as they lack the full set of keys
                    that their professional counterparts have. They are meant to only really last a student for a few years before becoming obsolete. If we're taking
                    the next step up to an intermediate model, you're now looking at prices around $3,000. These oboes? They aren't even real wood, they're resin.
                    They're still good quality, but one would hope that at that price point you would get something a bit more... real. Now let's move to professional oboes. This 
                    one is fun. They start at $7,000 new. Pocket change, really. Professional oboes are made of real wood, and have what is called a full conservatory system of keys. In layman's terms, this means
                    that you'd have all the keys you'd need to play professional, high-level music.  One issue, though: pro oboes have a lifespan of about 7-10 years, depending on
                    how heavily it is played. Granted, a pro oboe isn't necessary for someone who isn't looking to become a professional oboist. But can you imagine replacing this every 7 
                    years at such a high price point? I certainly can't - hell, my saxophones are decades old: my alto is over 80 years old, and my tenor, a professional model, is over 50 years old. 
                    They aren't made of wood. They don't "crack." They know better than that. You don't need to buy a new saxophone every 7 years. That's nonsense. Don't be like the oboe.

                <h3>A Poorly-Played Oboe Sounds Like a Dying Duck</h3>
                <p>I have a video of this under the "Examples" link above. The oboe is just that goddamn hard to play.
                    It is considered one of the most difficult wind instruments to play, and this doesn't surprise me. Anything this ridiculous has to be
                    difficult to deal with on many avenues. The double reed they use is so difficult to play that I've had several customers
                    come back after renting an oboe, stating that they just couldn't play the damn thing. Good on them, don't waste any more of your precious money. 
                    Get a guitar - or literally anything else - instead.

                <h3>Their double reeds are expensive (and most oboe players actually make their own)</h3>
                <p>I've heard of oboists having "reed making sessions." I can't make this shit up. It's a very complicated process
                    involving the use of very specialized equipment. On the same page as the aforementioned video of bad oboe playing, I included a video of the 
                    reed-making process. I can NOT imagine doing that. Do you know what I and what most other saxophonists do? We go to the goddamn store
                    and buy the reeds we want. Sure, some of us file our reeds or trim them, but that takes minutes, not hours. Reeds are expensive, but time is even more
                    expensive. Don't waste five hours on a reed just for it to turn out mediocre at best.

                <h3>Routine maintance is expensive</h3>
                <p>We are talking hundreds of dollars depending on what work is being done. This type of maintenace can 
                    apply to any instrument, especially professional instruments, but oboes have delicate keys, and I've more often
                    seen expensive oboe repairs than expensive, say, clarinet repairs. And you don't even keep the oboe more than 7-10 years,
                    so you're really not getting a good deal. The nature of the oboe's keys make them easier to bend and come out of alignment,
                    and those repairs will cost you. They won't cost as much as a routine cleaning/assessment/adjustment but 
                    they will still cost you a fair amount of money. Playing any given instrument as a hobby can be expensive, but usually not as expensive
                    as the costs associated with an oboe. In fairness, my baritone saxophone's repairs are VERY pricey, but that thing
                    is huge. It's also practically a tank, so it's not nearly as likely to get its keys bent. Be like the baritone sax. Don't be like the oboe.
