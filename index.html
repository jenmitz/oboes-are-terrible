                        Let me start off with a little of my background. I have been playing music for over 15 years, and have learned to play over a dozen different instruments in that timeframe. I am mainly a saxophone player now. 
                        My musical journey was frequently re-directed and shaped by being in some band that needed a particular instrument to be played. I always volunteered (enthusiastically) to cover the part - 
                        I'd learn the instrument, spending hours until I had a good grasp of the basics. It was always an enjoyable experience.
                        Basically, my musical-life-motto was "I've got you covered."

                    <p>There is one instrument, however, that I will not touch. Sometimes I'll break into a cold sweat when I merely hear its name. I'd bet good money that not even Lucifer himself would dare touch  such an abomination.
                        Now I need to mention that every instrument is ridiculous in its own right. Trust me when say that the French horn is absurd and 
                        arguably the most difficult brass instrument to play. Yet its challenge makes it all the more fun to play. The piano? Technically demanding as most others,
                        but the very nature of its keys' layout makes it easy to understand and learn. What I'm saying is that I understand the struggle in regards to instruments, simply because of how
                        many I have learned. Without exception, every single instrument has problems.
                        That being said, the oboe is the most obnoxious of all instruments to have ever plagued human-kind. I will adamantly hold to my opinion that most instruments will
                        never be as bad as the oboe until the day I die. Should I ever falter from this belief - this truth, really - please seek immediate medical attention for me.

                        <br>
                        You may be wondering how this hatred began in the first place, so let me tell you a bit more about myself. I worked at a family-owned music store
                        that catered to all musicians, but had a large focus on band instruments, supplies, and accessories. I eventually was put in charge of maintaining the professional instruments due to my diverse instrumental background,
                        and - you guessed it - that included the 5 intermediate and professional oboes they had.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I did this maintenance for about a year. Cue chaos and malcontent. I had to clean them every month, polish their delicate silver keys,
                        make sure their parts were greased, and inform and educate customers about them. I didn't like any of this, but the research I ended up 
                        doing just to educate customers correctly is what led me deeper into what I call The Abyss of Loathing. It brought a slew of facts and idiocies that only an oboe player could tolerate.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To wrap up, I don't care if you've never been in band, orchestra, symphony, or have ever even seen or touched an instrument. I think (actually, I <em>know</em>)
                        you'll understand why oboes are pretty awful and join me in my hatred. Hell, we could throw an anti-oboe party. I don't have many things in this world that I truly dislike,
                        but of the few on the list, oboes are near the top, along with off-brand frosted mini wheats and the 2018 movie Aquaman (seriously,
                        what the<em> hell </em>was that movie?)

                        So regardless of your musical background, come with me on a journey to The Abyss of Loathing while I take a proverbial shit on
                        the moronic piece of wood and metal that is an oboe along the way (fairly akin to a real tour guide, really, and just as painful). When you're ready to dive into the abhorrent nature of oboes (God     help you), click on any of the links at the top to start your journey, or click on one of the   links below.
