        <p>Oboes are the worst. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been playing music for over 10 years, and have learned to play over 10 different instruments in that timeframe. I am mainly a saxophone player now. 
            My musical journey was shaped by a group having a need for a particular instrument to be played. I always volunteered to cover the part - I'd learn the instrument until I had a good grasp of the basics. 
            Basically, my musical-life-motto was "I got you covered."
            <br>
            <br>
            There is one, however, that I will not touch. Sometimes I'll break into a cold sweat when I merely hear its name. I'd bet good money that not even Lucifer himself would dare touch such an abomination.
            Now I need to mention that every instrument is ridiculous in its own right. Trust me when I say that the french horn is absurd and 
            arguably the most difficult brass instrument to play. Yet its challenge makes it all the more fun to play. Clearly, I understand the struggle in regards to instruments. 
            Every single instrument has problems.
            That being said, the oboe is one of the most obnoxious instruments to have ever plagued human-kind. I will adamantly hold to my opinion that most instruments will
            never be as bad as oboes until the day I die. Should I ever falter from this belief - this truth, really - please seek immediate medical attention for me.
            <br>

            I don't care if you've never been in band, orchestra, symphony, or have ever even seen an instrument. I think
            you'll understand why oboes are pretty awful at the end of this all, and join me in my hatred. I don't have many things in this world that I truly dislike,
            but if the few on the list, oboes are near the top, along with off-brand frosted mini wheats and the 2018 movie Aquaman (seriously,
            what the<em> hell </em>was that movie?) 
            <br>
            <br>
            Regardless of your musical background, hear me out while I take a proverbial shit on
            the moronic piece of wood and metal that is called an oboe.

        <em>Disclaimer: I actually think oboes sound beautiful when played correctly, so no need for death threats, stating
        your close assoccation with the various oboe groups around the states and how you guys are all just dandy. I don't doubt that you are dandy. 
        I don't doubt that oboe players are great; in fact, I have a lot of respect for anybody who can tolerate playing the oboe and having the
        patience to do so. Make no mistake, though - while I respect oboe players, I do <strong>not</strong> respect oboes themselves.</em>
