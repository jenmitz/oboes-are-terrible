        <em>Disclaimer: I actually think oboes sound beautiful when played correctly, so no need for death threats, stating
        your close assoccation with the various oboe groups around the states and how you guys are all just dandy. I don't doubt that you are dandy. 
        I don't doubt that oboe players are great; in fact, I have a lot of respect for anybody who can tolerate playing the oboe and having the
        patience to do so. Make no mistake, though - while I respect oboe players, I do <strong>not</strong> respect oboes themselves.</em>
